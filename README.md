## Goals

What I wanted to accomplish with this project:
- Understand how to create a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing UI
- Understand how to utilize Flutter as a frontend framework
- Understand how to integrate Firebase services into a Flutter app
- Execute a project from start to finish

## Description

ChkIt is an app that is a fun and fresh way to keep track of all of your to do tasks. Simply list out all of your tasks and when you're ready,  upload a photo of your progress. ChkIt is not only a great way to keep you motivated to complete your tasks, but it's also a great way to remember all of your achievements!

## Specification

For this project I used Flutter and Firebase.

#### Firebase

This app features Firebase services for authentication, storage, and database management. Each user device will be anonomously logged in with a unique user id and will be able to access their tasks stored in Firestore. The app synchronizes tasks in real-time, ensuring that updates are reflected on their device.

#### Flutter

This app utilizes the Flutter framework which enabled me to create a visually appealing user interface. By implementing interactive components using its widget library, I was able to create an intuitive page to keep track of all tasks and images.
